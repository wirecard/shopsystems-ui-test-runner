# **ShopSystems UI Test Runner**

This project runs acceptance tests for Wirecard Shop Systems extensions. 

Supported Shop Systems
========

|  Shop system | Supported | This project used in CI |   
|---|---|:---:|  
| **Woocommerce** | &#9989; | &#9989; |


How to include project and run tests in continuous integration:
========
Clone to your workspace and use it in your workflow like in e.g
`https://github.com/wirecard/woocommerce-ee/blob/master/.github/workflows/run-acceptance-tests.yml` 


Configuring for other extension
=====
It is possible to extend this project with specific shop system. Add new data with respective output file paths in
`configuration.json` file content:
`````
{
  "woocommerce": {
      "html": "shopsystems-ui-testsuite/tests/_output/*.html",
      "xml": "shopsystems-ui-testsuite/tests/_output/*.xml",
      "png": "shopsystems-ui-testsuite/tests/_output/*.fail.png"
    }
}
`````

Also add a new folder for the respective shop system and it docker files with script for spinning the shop system.


Other
=====
In run-ui-tests.sh we have possibility to run ui tests on: 

    - https://github.com/wirecard/shopsystems-ui-testsuite master branch (this will be triggered after pull request changes in WooCommerce itself)
    - https://github.com/wirecard/shopsystems-ui-testsuite respective branch that has been created. In order to trigger 
      second workflow, github action will check for modified/added .feature files which will be stored inside $FEATURE_FILES variable.

Also, Wordpress version has been hardcoded and in case of increasing compatibility, this version has to be changed manually.
